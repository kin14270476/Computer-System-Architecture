## 2.2 notes
# 3.0 traffic lights
The task of this tutorial is to teach you how to use the traffic light software which used for simulating pair of traffic lights.
## 3.1 tutorial
When you first start the program it will close all the windows in the program and then a pop-up box which will show you the ram that this program has access to and what current adress the programe is at. The next thing the program will do is set the varible of AL to 30 in hexadecimal.

The traffic lights work by an 8bit binary string in which the first 3 bit control the left traffic light whilst the next 3 bit would control the right traffic light and the last 2 bit do nothing. The first bit signals the red light to be on, the second bit would singnal the yellow light and the third bit would signal the green light. An example of this would be the 10000100 which cause the left traffic light to be red and the right one to be green. As the software only accepts hexadecimal you need to convert the binary to hexadecimal so that you can send the value to the traffic lights. So if you used the previous example you would need to be 84 for it to turn the traffic light to the right colour
